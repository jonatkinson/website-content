### About

I'm a software engineer and I manage a software team. I'm also very interested in internet infrastructure and efficiency.

You can email me at [jon@jonatkinson.co.uk](mailto:jon@jonatkinson.co.uk).

_Note:_ I'm working on updating and publishing the content which was here previously, but it's a slow process.
