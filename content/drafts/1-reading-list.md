<a href="http://www.brycefarrah.com">Rob</a> and I were talking about our reading lists expanding into good business and marketing blogs the other day, and I mentioned a few but didn't really come up anything concrete. So here it is, my current (short) daily reading list:

<ul><li><a href="http://programming.reddit.com">programming.reddit.com</a> - generally interesting, with lots of discussion of exotic language techniques and a great deal of material covering functional languages.</li><li><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">codinghorror.com</a> - interesting anecdotes, mainly about newer languages and the web.</li><li><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Raw Though</a> - Aaron Swartz has always been the man.</li><li><a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">How to Change the World</a> - Guy Kawasaki is an interesting guy, and he has been around technology through several bubbles. Regardless of his own pedigree, he is also a talented journalist and the interviews he conducts are unusually frank.</li><li><a href="http://www.techquilashots.com/">Techquila Shots</a> - Daily (but getting less frequent) web application ideas. Most aren't groundbreaking, but most of the ideas do at least get me thinking at nine in the morning.</li><li><a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/">Get Rich Slowly</a> - Sensible investment advice, with a technology slant. It's US-centric, but the majority of strategies apply in the UK equally effectively.</li><li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin's Blog</a> - This blog isn't particularly original, it's the usual mix of marketing and meta-blogging which is done elsewhere, but Seth seems to understand the behaviour of groups so well that most of what he says is priceless.</li><li><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> - Well, obviously. I actually feel slightly embarrassed for starting to read this so long after everyone else did.</li></ul>

And just for comparison, here are a few sites which I <em>stopped</em> reading recently:

<ul><li><a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> - Even when combined with idiot removal scripts, recently Digg has become such bilge that I only glance at it once every few weeks. It is all very well trusting journalism to the wisdom of the crowd, but you have to remember that 95% of the crowd are morons.</li><li><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> - This used to be a great site, but it is past its prime; I've not read anything notable on Lifehacker for months, maybe its readers need to stop tweaking their working practices and just do some damn work.</li><li><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs Noise</a> - A good framework and great hype, very little substance. Unfortunately, the rule of simplicity cannot apply in all situations; I can't see their otherwise good web applications gaining traction until they accept that some business processes can be <em>complex</em>, and simplistic software cannot be justified in that scenario. Persistently dismissing this fact has made the blog difficult to read recently.</li></ul>
