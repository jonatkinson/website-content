I attended <a href="http://www.barcampblackpool.com">Barcamp Blackpool</a> this weekend, it was great. There was a really wide diversity of speakers and sessions (I attended sessions <a href="http://twitter.com/lallyd/">on sign language</a>, <a href="http://www.kianryan.co.uk/2009/10/an-android-app-in-20-minutes/">writing Android apps</a> and <a href="http://www.agm.me.uk/blog/">geocaching</a>, among others). 

This was the first time I'd been to a Barcamp, and I liked the format. Hayley, who doesn't attend geek events often at all, said that while the content of the talks was generally technical, the fact everyone spoke with passion meant that all the talks were entertaining, even if you didn't understand the entirely of what was being said. Having sat through a really entertaining hour of looking at circuit diagrams to <a href="http://cazmockett.com/blog/">control a church organ with a BBC micro</a>, I totally agree.

I was also very pleased with the reaction to the <a href="http://img202.yfrog.com/i/7ha.jpg/">rock and lollipops</a> which <a href="http://www.testled.com">Testled</a> provided. Looking round the room and seeing everyone with bright blue mouths has convinced me that the business card is dead; branded confectionary is much more effective. Testled's sponsorship in general has been a positive for us (this was the first time we're done any event sponsorship), I certainly found it easier to approach potential customers with a little more legitimacy than before. I think we're going to micro-sponsor Barcamp Manchester as a result, so if anyone is anxious for more blue lollies, you won't have long to wait.

I won't repeat what has already been said about the great sponsored bar, the magician (who I think might now be performing at our wedding), and the food, but I will repeat the thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/ruby_gem/">Gemma</a> for organising such an awesome day. See you all next year (or maybe at Barcamp London this weekend).
