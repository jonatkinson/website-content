My delightful thing of the day is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Brass">Acid Brass</a>:<blockquote>Acid Brass was a musical collaboration between Turner-Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller and the Williams Fairey Brass Band. The project was based on fusing the music of a traditional brass band with acid house and Detroit techno.</blockquote>

There are some limited examples <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acid+brass&search_type=&aq=f">on Youtube</a>.
