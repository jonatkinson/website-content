I've just finished at Barcamp London. It was worth going, but very busy, probably a little too busy. There were so many rooms that I had to choose between two good talks in each session, which was great for the event, but not so easy for me.

The standout sessions were the elevator pitching practise, which was a lot of fun once the room warmed up a little, and it's definately an idea which I'm going to steal for <a href="http://bcman2.nwdc.org.uk/">Barcamp Manchester</a>. Less fun, but nevertheless interesting was the session on the <a href="https://www.x.com/blog/">new Paypal APIs</a>. We've been considering moving <a href="http://www.testled.com">Testled's</a> payment provider to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/fps/">Amazon's Flexible Payments Service</a>, but it looks like in a few weeks we'll be able fulfil all of our requirements (mainly on-site micropayments) without changing provider.

Also, a quick note to those attending Barcamp Manchester, Testled are again sponsoring a small part of the event, so we'll be bringing yet more of our popular blue lollipops. I bet you all can't wait.
