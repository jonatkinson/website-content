I've been working on a couple of snippet collections for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/">yasnippet</a> recently, which I never got around to writing about.

First is <a href="http://github.com/jonatkinson/yasnippet-licenses/tree/master">yasnippet-licenses</a>, which contains a set of short and long-form <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/">FSF licenses</a>. It should suit the fastidious, who like to license each file correctly.

Second is <a href="http://github.com/jonatkinson/yasnippet-django/tree/master">yasnippet-django</a>, which is a fairly comprehensive set of snippets from Django 1.0 models, forms and templates. It isn't my own work, just a conversion of the excellent set of TextMate snippets by <a href="http://bitbucket.org/bkerr/django-textmate-bundles/wiki/Home">Brian Kerr</a>.
