I get quote a lot of traffic to my entry on <a href="http://jonatkinson.co.uk/paypal-encrypted-buttons-django/">encrypting Paypal buttons with Django</a>. I was pleased to see that <a href="http://github.com/johnboxall">John Boxall</a> has created <a href="http://github.com/johnboxall/django-paypal/tree/master">django-paypal</a>, a nice clean pluggable Django application for dealing with Paypal payments in Django projects which uses a few of the ideas I developed in my original post.

Hopefully this means that I can move a little bit quicker on a few projects I'm working on, like the <a href="http://www.mampi.co.uk">Mampi</a> payment system.
