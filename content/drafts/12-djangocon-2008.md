I realise I'm ridiculously late to this party, but I'm just catching up with the videos from <a href="http://www.djangocon.org">DjangoCon 2008</a>. I've seen quite a few amusing talks this year (hat tip to <a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/schedule/MattJones.php">Matt and Matt's talk at dConstruct</a>, which gets second place), but Cal Henderson's "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk">Why I hate Django</a>" is one of the best.

<a href="http://www.djangopony.com">Djangopony</a> now makes more sense, anyway.
