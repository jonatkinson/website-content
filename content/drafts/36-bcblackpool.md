I rather enjoyed Barcamp Blackpool this weekend. I've been to a lot of conferences and Barcamps this year, but I did particularly enjoy a Barcamp on my home soil.

I made an effort this weekend to spend less time in talks, and more time talking to people, and I think it paid off. Along with giving my (now rather tired) session on pitching, I had some very rewarding one-to-ones with a some very smart people - so if I cornered you and wouldn't stop talking, take it as a compliment! 

I did, however spend time in some talks. <a href="http://twitter.com/timhastings">@timhastings</a> talk on <a href="http://tagwalk.com/">TagWalk</a> was very interesting, though I would have enjoyed more detail on the code running the site, but then I always like to skip ahead.

<a href="http://twitter.com/walterja/">@walterja</a>, whose talks have become the highlight of the last few Barcamp events  I've attended, presented a predictably fascinating look at sociometry, which I've had some experience with before, though with a very different intention. I think this talk brought together the most diverse members of the audience, it was great to see so many teachers in the audience.

The evening was a lot of fun, and talking to people I was pleased with how many were talking about their own projects, startups and ideas for what is next; very invigorating.

Most blog posts end with thanks for the sponsors, which I would like to echo, but I think someone needs to call out the excellent work of <a href="http://twitter.com/ruby_gem">@ruby_gem</a>, who seems to have the ability to pull together these events, run them flawlessly and make it look incredibly easy. You are an asset to us all. Thank very much for your work.

Oh, and I won the PadRacer tournament ;-)
